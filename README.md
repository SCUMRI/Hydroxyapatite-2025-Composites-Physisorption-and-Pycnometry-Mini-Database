This repository contains pycnometry and physisorption data (BET surface area). The pycnometry data at different sintering temperature corresponds is for composites of HA/Alginate and HA/polyurethane. The joint physisorption and pycnometry database is for HA/Alginate slabs sintered at 300 C.
The excel file "Hydroxyapatiterecordoftests.xlsx" contains the experimental conditions and key for the raw data pycnometry and physisorption files.
The foundation of this effort was presented at the SCU School of Engineering Research Symposium by Alex Giannopoulos and Kenneth Pan.
